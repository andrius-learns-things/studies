# Studies

Repo for keeping notes, experiments and other studies related stuff.

It has:

# Buzzword index

# Bookmarked useful links

# CheatSheet

# Tools

## 1. Pre-commit setup

Done:
- Pre-commits with black & flake8
- Flake8 complexity enforcement?

Ideas:
- run.sh script, solved docker sudo problems
- Full test coverage enforcement?

[Link](/tools/pre-commits)

# Experiments:

## 1. Python script, experimenting with queries of three DBs: Redis, MongoDB and PostgreSQL

[Link](/experiments/1/)

To run, execute `docker-compose up`

Status: In progress...

Done:
- Redis POC
- Mongo POC
- Mounted source files
- PostgreSQL POC
- One entity experiment with all providers
- Add time measurements
- Scale up
- Indexes

Todo:
- Another experiment: Two entities and JOINS
  - Provider by provider
- Another provider - SQL Alchemy + migrations
- Why no perf improvement with postgres index?
- MySql?
- Couchbase?

Ideas:
- PostgresAdmin? Other kind of admins?

## 2. PDB debugging with docker and flask

DONE.

See [Link](/experiments/2/Readme.md)


## 3. Swagger UI served for trivial flask app

Following https://medium.com/@sean_bradley/add-swagger-ui-to-your-python-flask-api-683bfbb32b36

DONE.

See [Link](/experiments/3/)

## 4. Swagger autogenerated by FlaskRestPlus

Following https://towardsdatascience.com/working-with-apis-using-flask-flask-restplus-and-swagger-ui-7cf447deda7f

DONE.

## 5. Graphene lib for GraphQL in python

FAILED. Got stuck at https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene/issues/546
