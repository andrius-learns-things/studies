## 1. Pre-commit setup

Done:
- Pre-commits with black & flake8

# Experiments:

## 1. Python script, experimenting with queries of three DBs: Redis, MongoDB and PostgreSQL

[Link](/experiments/1/)

To run, execute `docker-compose up`

Status: In progress...

Done:
- Redis POC
- Mongo POC
- Mounted source files
- PostgreSQL POC
- One entity experiment with all providers
- Add time measurements
- Scale up
- Indexes

Todo:
- Why no perf improvement with postgres index?
- ORM and migrations for postgres
- More entities and JOINS
- MySql?
- Couchbase?

Ideas:
- PostgresAdmin? Other kind of admins?

## 2. PDB debugging with docker and flask

DONE.
