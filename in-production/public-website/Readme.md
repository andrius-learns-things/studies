# Public website

TODO:

- Take static website template (Exp #11), transform it on Next.js static website generator (Exp #10)
- Find hosting solution combination, which would support: CDN hosting & Domain & SSL Cert
- Setup Travis CI to build and deploy
- Setup usage metrics somehow (Google analytics?)
